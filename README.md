# Dungeonhack

This repository contains the source of Dungeonhack http://dungeonhack.sourceforge.net and it's dependencies. I got it compiling and running under Windows 10 using Visual Studio 2015.

It should be clear that the Copyright of Dungeonhack and of it's dependencies not in my hand.

My intention for this repository is to get a deeper understanding of game programing.

IMPORTANT: Remove the Builddependencies from dungeonhack after the first build to speed up the next build's
